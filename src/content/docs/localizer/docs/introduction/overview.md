title: Localizer Overview
---

Localizer is a localization tool kit for applications written on Borland Delphi or C++ Builder. It allows to process most of string resources in your project: 
 · properties of components on the forms;  
 
 · resource string constants;  
 
 · Delphi packages and DLLs;  
 
 · VCL messages and messages from third-party packages.  
 
   

Support for additional language(s) can be added without recompilation the project, even by your end users. 
The main difference between Localizer and other similar packs is that Localizer can use standard resource DLLs to store localized resources (string data mainly). This feature is similar to the one in Borland Delphi localization tool - Integrated Translation Environment. 
Other features of Localizer are the following: 
 · minimum of additional code required for application localizing. In some cases you don't need any code to add to your application;  
 
 · you don't need to use Delphi to translate application interface. It allows to separate application development from translation process;  
 
 · you can process the resourcestring section in your project units and, therefore, translate Delphi packages and DLLs, VCL and third-party components messages.
